<h1 class="content">History</h1>
<p> In 1971, the Bataan School of Fisheries opened its gates for its first year of operation. It offered a Secondary Technical Vocational Program with specialization in Fish Capture, Fish Culture and Fish Preservation. BSF then expanded its curricular program in 1975 to offer a three-year Post Secondary Diploma in Fisheries Technology (DFT) with specialization in Marine Fisheries, Aquaculture, and Fish Processing. However, in 1994, BSF was placed under TESDA (Technical Education and Skills Development Authority) supervision through R.A. 7796. During this period, BSF gained accreditation for the offering of Basic Seamanship, Garments Technology and One-Year Computer Literacy Course in addition to the FBPS, FPST, and DFT. In 1998, Bataan School of Fisheries opted to return to the supervision of the Department of Education, Culture, and Sports, Department of Education (DepEd). BSF also started to conduct TESDA-supervised trade tests for graduating students in Garment Technology. <br> <br>
	Bataan School of Fisheries gained accreditation in 1999 as an assessment center for Food Trades and Computer Encoding for graduates of FBPS and the One-Year Computer Literacy Program. In 2007, BSF was identified as the pilot school for the implementation of the Strengthened Technical-Vocational Education Program (STEVEP) of the Department of Education. It also started to conduct TESDA. Supervised Competency Assessment for its graduating high schools. <br> <br>
	In addition, in 2008, BSF contracted a Memorandum of Agreement with Bataan Peninsula State University (BPSU) for the College consortium to offer Bachelor of Science in Fisheries and Associate in Computer Technology programs. Which then in 2010, Bataan School of Fisheries was identified as a National Benchmarking School for Department Heads of Fishery Schools throughout the Philippines. <br> <br>
	Further, in 2012, BSF was identified as a Modelling Tech-Voc School in Fisheries for the Grade 11 and Grade 12 Senior High School of the K-12 Program.
